    <h2>Cats</h2>
      <p>Cats were first domesticated around 7500 BCE in the western Asia region
        and are currently the second most popular domestic pet in the United States.
        While there are over 60 unique documented cat breeds, care and diet can differ
        between breeds. However, some diets and practices are generally recommended
        for the well-being of your fluffy family member regardless of breed.</p>

        <h3>Kitten Growth Milestones</h3>
          <h4>Zero to Four Weeks</h4>
            <p>It is important the queen (a term commonly used for a female cat that is
              either pregnant or nursing) directly nurse her young if possible. Monitor
              your kittenâ€™s growth closely to make sure its growth rate is progressing
              steadily. If any kitten is not growing at a sufficient rate, a caretaker
              might need to feed the kitten directly either with a bottle or a feeding
              tube. Some reasons why kittens might not gain weight appropriately include the following:</p>
              too many other siblings are competing for mom's milk<br>
              gastrointestinal disease<br>
              environmental conditions such as extreme heat or cold, or unsanitary conditions
              <br>
              <hr>
          <h4>Four Weeks to One Year</h4>
            <p>Kittens can start being introduced to soft wet kitten food typically
              around three to four weeks after birth. According to the ASPCA, kittens
              at this age should eat half to one cup of dry kitten food or six to nine
              ounces of wet kitten food per day. If your kitten has difficulties eating
              hard food, a small amount of water can be added to soften the food. Cat
              food that is optimized for kittens provides the additional nutrients that
              are needed for growth, energy, and wellness. Depending on the breed, your
              cat may have different dietary requirements. You should always consult with
              your veterinarian for recommendations.</p>

            <h4>One Year to Seven Years</h4>
              <p>This age is when kittens reach the cat stage and do not need as many
                nutrients. At this age, their level of activity decreases, and so does
                their metabolism. It is not recommended to leave food out for the cats
                all day. Instead, provide food a couple times a day so they eat meals
                rather than snacking throughout the day. This practice reduces the risk
                of obesity and other weight-related feline ailments.</p>

            <h4>Seven Years and More</h4>
              <p>Much like many living organisms, the body begins to deteriorate and
                experience a lot of changes. Cats at this age should eat less fats and
                calories and more quality proteins. This means when you are purchasing
                packaged foods for your cat, look for food that states a particular protein
                (such as "salmon") and not just a category (such as fish). This usually
                means they are byproducts, or combinations, of lesser quality proteins.</p>
