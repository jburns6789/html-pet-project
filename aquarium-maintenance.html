    <h2>Aquarium-maintenance</h2>
      <p>Fish represent a broad class of aquatic animals that can live in fresh or
      saltwater, depending on the species. Bringing fish into your home can be an
      exciting hobby, especially if you intend to breed them, and the presence of
      a fish tank in your home can induce feelings of peace and tranquility.
      Whether you are bringing your fish home for the first time or maintaining your
      aquarium, it is important to test your water once per week to ensure it is free
      from toxins that can harm your fish.</p>

      <h3>Freshwater Fish</h3>
      <p>There are several freshwater fish to choose from when setting up your aquarium,
      but it is best to consult with a “Pexpert” to ensure your fish will get along!
      No matter the species, ensure your fish are suited for a freshwater environment
      by investing in a water testing kit. Follow these general water chemistry
      guidelines to ensure your fish will adapt well to your aquarium and avoid ingesting
      toxins that can harm or kill your fish:</p>
      <br>
      •	pH Level: 6.8–7.6 (7.0 is considered neutral)<br>
      •	Ammonia: any level above zero is harmful to fish<br>
      •	Nitrates: 5 to 10 ppm<br>
      •	Nitrites: less than 0.5 ppm

      •	Ammonia: any level above 0.1 ppm requires attention<br>
      •	Nitrates: 10 to 40 ppm<br>
      •	Nitrites: less than 0.2 ppm<br>
